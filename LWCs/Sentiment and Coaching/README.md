# Sentiment and Coaching

A demo package that adds **sentiment analysis** and **agent performance coaching** for **Voice** (Service Cloud Voice) and **Messaging** (chat) interactions. It uses Einstein generative AI prompt templates, flows, Apex, and Lightning Web Components to evaluate calls and chats and store results on Voice Call and Messaging Session records.

## What It Does

- **Voice (SCV)** – After a call, flows extract **call sentiment** and **agent performance** from transcript/content, then store ratings and evaluations on the **Voice Call** record. LWCs display coaching and sentiment on the call record.
- **Messaging** – After a chat, flows extract **chat sentiment** and **coaching** from the conversation, then store ratings and evaluations on the **Messaging Session** record. An LWC shows analytics on the session record.

All of this is powered by **Einstein Prompt Templates** (GenAI) and is intended for demo or pilot use in Service Cloud Voice and Messaging/Omni-Channel setups.
